# MNIST
This iPython notebook contains a simple Convolutional Neural Network Model for handwritten digits classification with 97% accuracy and is built with Tensorflow
The implementation is based on the data from Kaggle MNIST data set and thus is in that format only. For any other use the sources of data and the code for testing should be changed.
